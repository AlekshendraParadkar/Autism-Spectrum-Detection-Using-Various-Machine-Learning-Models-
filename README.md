# 🧠 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** using multiple machine learning algorithms. ASD is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior, and early detection is crucial for timely intervention. By leveraging data and machine learning, we attempt to assist in identifying individuals who may be at risk of ASD through predictive modeling.

## 📁 Project Overview

The notebook `atsdanalysis.ipynb` covers the complete pipeline for ASD detection:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and comparison
- Performance evaluation using classification metrics

The primary goal is to determine which classification algorithm performs best on the dataset and could potentially assist in building diagnostic tools.
